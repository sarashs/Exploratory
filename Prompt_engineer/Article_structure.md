## Motivation

- While agentic AI is increasingly replacing traditional task-based prompt engineering, certain NLP data processing tasks still benefit from classical Q&A prompting. These tasks typically share two features: (1) They are terminal, requiring only a single-step interaction rather than hierarchical or sequential execution; (2) The volume of data to process places practical limits on the number of allowed LLM interactions, making single-prompt solutions preferable. Examples include text classification, sentiment analysis, compliance monitoring of electronic communications, and control monitoring.
- Prompt engineering remains a challenging and labor-intensive process, with prior efforts attempting to automate it \[reference needed\]. Our work builds on these efforts by framing prompt engineering as a reinforcement learning policy optimization problem. Specifically, we employ an $\epsilon$-greedy strategy to optimize prompt selection, aiming to maximize task-specific metric scores (expected rewards) on labeled datasets.
